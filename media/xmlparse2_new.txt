1 Goal
======

  Need to parse patent text files to extract patent number, and two
  specific sections.


2 Data
======

  - Focus on Patent Grant Full Text Data (No Images) (JAN 1976 -
    PRESENT) from this page: [https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/]

  - Need to parse all patetns from the subset from 2002 to 2016, so:
    - [https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/patent/grant/redbook/fulltext/2002]
    - [https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/patent/grant/redbook/fulltext/2003]
    - ...
    - [https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/patent/grant/redbook/fulltext/2016/]


  There may be slight differences across the years in document
  structure, but basics are similar. Here is the 4.2 DTD.
  [https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/products/PatentGrantXMLv42-Documentation.pdf]

  Please test for a few inputfiles from each type of DTD ... I don't
  believe this is well structured XML however.


3 Fields we want to keep
========================

  Each file contains all patents for a week. Each patent is denoted by a
  <document-id> following <publication-reference>.

  - The patent number <!element publication-reference (document-id)>
  - All paragraphs from DETDES
  - All paragraphs from BRFSUM


4 Output format: tab delimited
==============================

  COL 1: document-id COL 2: Section (either DETDESC or BRFSUM) COL 3:
  Paragraph number COL 4: The text of DETDESC or BRFSUM paragraph


5 The command
=============

  Ideally something like python xmlpatparse.py [inputXMLfile] -o
  [outputCSVfile]


6 Process
=========

  Try on first and last file from every other year; let me review then
  iterate with tweaks.


7 Applying
==========

  Would be helpful (but not essential) if you could send an excerpt from
  one output file or part of one with your application.
